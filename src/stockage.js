                                languages that we never used during our training, and now we must make an online multiplayer pong game website. Quite challenging.\n\
                                I could go for an entire page about Transcendence, but to be short, for the biggest section: pcapurro and I  both made the  UI, the accessibility (that is truely hell),\
                                the RGPD and data-anonymization. Pcapurro made the game, the game statistics and the game customization. I made the 42 API authentification, the python-django \
                                backend and the  p2p multiplayer (that you sadly won't be able to use unless you own a 42 account).\
